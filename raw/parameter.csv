It has generally been the case that **PSI** did not allow vowel sequences. So
**PSI** presumably had a phonetic glide preceding {-e}, which probably had
morphemic status.  We are unable to reconstruct the glide.  The second

undergone a little irregular vowel harmony. In such cases its identity
became opaque, and we see the same prefix reapplied in MVS. Frequent
reapplication of {wa-} ‘something’ leaves the old initial syllable in
second position, and vowel length has naturally shifted to it in MVS. The DH
forms look as though they have been additionally restructured recently. They
should have uniform reflexes of the final syllable {*-nǫ}. The oral
consonant, falling between two nasal vowels, betrays the reanalysis that has
occurred here. Evidently the initial syllable, {mǫ} (the older
incorporated object), was interpreted as the root, and the final syllable
was reinterpreted as an instance of **PDH** {*ʔǫ} ‘**905**’, the original
{n} was dropped and the common intervocalic glide, {r} inserted. The
**CR** and **HI** forms may be compounds of ‘**111**’ (**PCH** {*ašÉ}) and ‘steal’

approximate reconstruction might be {*ša•ku•pa} or {*ša•ku•pą}. **DA** and
**WI** show an apparently remodeled late form clearly based on {*ša•k-}
‘hand’ and {-wį} ‘one’, based in turn on the hand signal for ‘seven’ in
the sign language. The second fist (closed) represents ‘**320**’ and the same
with the index finger extended ‘seven’, i.e., ‘fist + one’. The {-o-} is
interpretable as ‘locative’ but may just be a relic of an original,
unanalizable {-u-}, folk etymologized as ‘locative {o-}’. The
reanalysed form would presumably have diffused through parts of MVS. DH and
**BI** innovate, using an entirely non-cognate, quinary term.  The OVS forms look
primitive, not remodeled, for two reasons: a) OVS quite regularly shows
{*č < **š} in ‘hand’, while ‘seven’ has only {*s}, and b) the {*wį}
root, ‘**518**’, seems to be restricted to MVS (and possibly **MA**); OVS shows
only ‘**519**’. Also, shared remodeling in the neighboring **DA** and **WI** seems
quite ordinary; if the OVS forms are following the same pattern, then it
would presumably be a convergence, rather than a shared innovation, and we
find that more exceptional. Another possible argument has to do with the
{*wį} root itself: this root is one of those where the {*w} does not
nasalize to {m}. In **CH** and OVS, however, the word for ‘seven’ does exhibit
this nasalization. We think the **DA** alternants with first syllable stress are
due to contamination with ‘**320**’, presumably from serial counting.  This is
one of the terms in which **TU** |s|, instead of the expected |*č|, corresponds
to **PSI** |*š|.  The two long vowels plus the **MA** form suggest that the word was
morphemically complex to begin with.  We know that **CR**/**HI** |-ua| represents loss
of an intervocallic glide -- typically |h|, possibly |w|.  We also know that
**CR**/**HI** |hp| results from a cluster, here most likely |*kp|. That enables us
to back up from the attested forms to something like |*šakpuha|.  The last
steps come from the reasonably well-attested rightward vowel transposition,
which generally swaps a |u| for some vowel in the succeeding syllable.  The
exchanged vowel has evidently been lost.  Restoring it gives us |*šakVpuha|,
from which undoing rightward vowel transposition gives us |*šakupVha|.  The
nasality of the **PSI** final vowel remains unresolved.",,1

several languages.  The ‘snake’ extension of the term is found in **CH**/**WI** with
possible further intrusion into DH shown by the derived ‘water monster’ form
in **OP** (‘medicine man’ in other DH languages.)  All of DH may once have been
included since (a) the simple form {*wahką́} is lacking, and (b) ‘snake’
has been systematically replaced with {*wesʔá} ‘one that drips or hisses
(?)’ throughout DH.  Possible extension of this ‘snake’ term to Virginia
Siouan may ultimately tell us something about the chronology of movements of
**TU** and **SP** into the East. **TU** apparently has a reflex of the present term while
**SP** has a reflex of ‘**582**’ like **OF** and **BI**. **PSI** {*wąhką}, ‘**582**’,
q.v., with its initial-syllable nasal vowel, is not derivationally related
to |wahką́| in any obvious way.  Nevertheless, the two terms, perhaps because
of their superficial similarity, have become intertwined semantically.  Each
has undergone specialization to ‘snake’ in certain languages.  Ives Goddard
(p.c.) reports that the sacred/snake mixture is found in adjacent Algonquian
languages also. Paul H. Voorhis (p.c.) suggests that this mixture may be just
euphemism. Snakes obviously have a large dose of mystic power, and one refers
to them by this, rather than by their proper names so as not to attract
them. Fox and Kickapoo have also merged ‘god’ and ‘snake’ in {manetoowa},
and then created new expressions to distinguish them, Fox {(manetoowa)
kiiyootaata} ‘crawling manitou’ for ‘snake’, and Kickapoo {(manetoowa)
kiisihiaata} ‘creating manitou’ for ‘god’. Throughout central Algonquian
‘bugs’ are literally ‘little gods’, a similar euphemism?  Anyway, {wakhą}
‘snake’ and {wakhą} ‘sacred’ are surely the same word in origin. **CH** and
DH forms in {*-ta} are included to indicate the presence of the root

stressed when used with |yá| ‘**775**’ (but not with |ú| ‘**976**’); when we compare

of the second consonant also. Alternate forms with differing suffixes show
clearly that these are highly derived forms in both subgroups. They may, in

accented proto-vowel easy to explain. DH frequently undergoes merger of
{*ų} and {*ą} to {ą} but **DA** does not normally follow this pattern.

independent verb and a cliticized auxiliary verb in **HI**, and strictly a
cliticized auxiliary in **CR** and the rest of the Siouan language family.

Historically it seems to have been a verb with medial inflection for person
|*hi-_-E|.  **MA** and **HI** have both normalized inflection in the independent verb
by moving person markers to the left of the initial element.  When the **HI**
auxiliary is suffixed to verbs in final |-E|, however, the original order of
elements is preserved and indicated by the |-hi-| which appears between the
final consonant of the root and the suffixed causative person markers.  The
historical order is also reflected in Dakotan and DH, where aspiration
appears with the possessive reflexive ahead of the personal pronouns, and in
the |hi| element which appears ahead of the pronouns in **BI**.

The glide which appears in many of the languages between the person markers
and |-E| is epenthetic everywhere but not reconstructible to a single **PSI**
glide.  Here, we represent it as |*(r)| because that fits every language but
**BI**.  This is a notational convention only, however.  Except in the reflexive
possessive, Dakotan and DH have lost initial |*hi-|.  In contrast, **CH**/**WI** seem
generally to have lost |*-(r)E|, retaining it only in fossilized
(unconjugated) form with some verbs (cf. ‘**727**’, ‘**854**’).  In modern **CH**/**WI** the pronouns follow
|*hi-| as if the remainder of the causative were still present.  In all
probability, |*-(r)E| has simply been absorbed by the pronouns.  This is
clearly the case in **HI**, where the short vowels of the pronominal prefixes are
long in the causative.  Reconstruction is facilitated by considering the
ordinary and the reflexive causatives together.

initial stop in the **BI** reflex as lenis.  Cf. ‘**912**’, ‘**778**’, which have the
expected lenis stops.  Vowel length is indeterminate because there are
questions about its reflexes in the languages that show it.  **HI** and **MA**, for
example, level glottal paradigms so that sometimes inherited glottalized
stops (regular only in third person) appear throughout the paradigm,
sometimes are absent throughout the paradigm, and (rarely) are preserved in
their regular distribution.  This verb in contrast with ‘**912**’ suggests that,
when the glottal is lost, the vowel is lengthened in both **MA** and **HI**.

Glottals are always lost in **CR**, with lengthening and usually with rising

924,{},924,day,"MRS loses |-h-| and fuses the (innovated) prefix with the root. The
sporadic loss of |#h-| in MVS is unusual.  The **OP** and **CH** forms without
initial |h-| may well be borrowings from **DA**, since of the remaining MVS
languages, these are the two most closely associated with **DA** speakers.  The
**PN** form is from Frida Hahn’s correspondence with Franz Boas (via JEK).

(Hahn, a native speaker of German, had no trouble distinguishing long vowels
from short in **OP**, and her transcriptions are especially valuable for that
reason.)
The semantics of the OVS prefix, |ną-|, is not understood, but cf. |oną|
‘prairie fire’ as well as the ‘by heat’ instrumental for possibilities.  If
the prefix were **PSI** the MVS languages should have an initial reflex of
|*r-h| (the product of syncope), but they do not, so we must look upon
|*ną-| as a southeastern innovation.  The correspondences here are not those
that we reconstruct as |*rh| in, e.g., ‘**217**’ or ‘**1158**’.  This suggests
that **TU** may have remained most faithful to the original with **BI** and **OF** losing
|-h-| and collapsing the vowel sequence.  This is another term in which we
have OVS unity opposed to the rest of Siouan.

An alternative hypothesis also has its attractions.  If the **PSI** form were
|*ą́•pE| the lack of |*h| in **CR**, **HI**, **DA**, **OP**, IO, **BI**, **OF** would need no
explanation, and its presence in the other languages could be fairly
convincingly ascribed to analogy with ‘night’, q.v., which does have the
initial |h|.  Some evidence for this is provided by the term for
‘**623**’, q.v., in which even more of the languages lack the |h-|.  **CA**
also lacks |h|.  Unfortunately loss of |h| could be regular anyway in **CR**/**HI**,
**BI** and **OF**, so the hypothesis only aids us in analysis of IO (as opposed to
**OT**) and **OP** (as opposed to the rest of DH).  But these are the languages most
influenced by neighboring **DA**, so this counter proposal does not explain as
much as one would hope.  **DA** is the language that really needs to be
explained.  One possibility is that the noun is deverbal, as Dakotan appears
to lose root-initial |h| in verbs.  Use of this root in various ‘sunrise’

|*ks|.  The MVS languages, in particular DH, seem to innovate the numbered
daughter birth names, and that system seems to diffuse northward across DH

simplification to the preferred disyllabic structure of lexical roots (with
subsequent loss of |r| from its initial position in the resulting cluster)

**OS**/**KS** nasalization is irregular, but may be explained in terms of the
cognate **OP** form.  Numeral terms meaning ‘do once, do twice’, etc., in DH are
formed by suffixing |ǫ|, a reflex of **PDH** |*ʔǫ| ‘**905**’, to the basic
number. In the process, the |ǫ| frequently fuses with the final vowel of the
number so that, e.g., |†nǫbá + †ʔǫ > nǫbą́| ‘twice’, but |†ðą́•bðį + †ʔǫ >
ðá•bðį| ‘thrice’. The same process may have taken place here, |†wačhí + †ʔǫ|
giving |wačhį́|.  **OP** uses |gá•ɣe|, the modern verb ‘make’ to form dance and
may be thought of as a modern calque of the historical form with reflexes

generally denotes |*a| while |u| is from |*u|.  If there is really |ŭ|, then
the prefix is |dak-| from **PSI** |*raka-| ‘by striking’ with a root |sǫ|.

Otherwise the prefix is |du-| ‘by hand/pulling’ and a root |ksǫ|.  The
initial prefix is the locative in either event.  The remainder of the stem
presents other problems.  If the parenthetical (|atŭkse’oⁿni|) is a correct
analysis, then the forms are not cognate at all.  If it is D&S’s incorrect
analysis, cognacy is still possible. The problem is that |-soⁿni| can come
from |*sǫ-re| or from |*se-(h)ǫ-re| where |*(h)ǫ-re| is the auxiliary ‘**905**’.  Either is possible, but the second of the two entries suggests that
|-se-| is an incorrect analysis, so we may have cognates here.",,1
957,{},957,count,"The root is presumably always combined with {*ra-} ‘**556**’. **HI**

cucurbit terms with origins in Algonquian.  What we have reconstructed as **PDA**

The actually occurring forms for ‘**766**’, q.v., may have originated in
several different Algonquian dialects, where the reconstructible PA form is
|*e•mehkwa•ni|.  Compare also Kickapoo |eemehkwaani| ‘spoon’ (Voorhis 1988),
Menomini |ɛ•mɛhkwan| ‘squash, melon, seed’ (Goddard p.c.).  Note that |*kw|,
Dakotan |gm, mn|, **CH**/**WI** |dw, čw| is not a native cluster in Siouan.  These
terms virtually have to be loanwords, and Algonquian provides an attractive
source.",,1
959,{},959,"cottonwood, poplar","**CR** |báhkuhpa| ‘cotton, cottonwood’ (GG-25) and **HI** |wáhku| , |máhku|
‘cottonwood’ reflect **PCH** |*wahku|. The **PCH** form is potentially the result of
rightward vowel exchange, implying the existence of an earlier |**wuhka|.

But this form is unlikely to derive from a yet earlier |**wuxka| since **PCH**
|*xk| clusters which become |hk| in **HI** are preserved in **CR**.  Rather, the
postulated earlier form implies |**wuC-ka| where |C| is a stop consonant, cf.

the sitting and lying positionals for parallel phonological development.

Preaspiration is thus unaccounted for by the postulated earlier form with
|x|.  If we do not appeal to rightward vowel exchange, then the final |u| is
unaccounted for and the disappearance of |x| remains a mystery. Thus it is
not clear that the **CR**/**HI** forms are even cognate here.

Like **CR**/**HI**, **BI** |†maxǫ́tka| , |maxóⁿtka| ‘palmetto’ (DS-229a) and **OF** |†amašúpka|
, |amashû´pka| ‘palmetto’ DS-320b appear superficially similar to the central
Siouan forms.  **BI**, however, may be a compound with ‘**757**’ (not
independently attested otherwise in **BI**), and **OF** may be a compound with ‘soft’
(**OF** |sxû´pka| DS-329a), leaving only |*ama-| for **PBO**.

In all the instances of |*W| that we have seen so far, it derives from a
succession of syllables containing simple |*w|, e.g.  |*wVwV´| with
subsequent loss of the initial syllable vowel via the usual syncope.  This
leaves |*w-wV´|, which gives |*W|.  This solution appears to work well here
too.  Note the initial accent, which, along with the reflexes of |W|,
signals the lost initial syllable. Various subgroups and individual
languages have modified the term with the common |-ka| or the mysterious
|ʔe| or |ʔa|.  Note that |ʔe| is a root for ‘**873**’ in some languages, so the
‘cottonwood’ term may be a compound.

The probable cognate forms appear limited to MVS and **MA** only.  The fact that
there exist look-alikes in the more northerly and southerly Siouan languages
and forms such as Proto-North-Caddoan |*wasa•| (Allan R. ART) strongly
suggest that we are dealing at least partly with a diffused term here.",,1
961,{},961,corn ear,"**HI** |hú•pa•ti| ‘**961**’, |wa•hú•pa|, |ma•hú•pa| ‘corncob’ (J) are not
directly cognate.  They appear to be derived from **CR**/**HI** |hú•pa| ‘**732**’, q.v.; likewise **MA** |húpatka| ‘ear of corn’ (H).  Their superficial
similarity to the MVS term |hápa| is seductive, but corn only penetrated the
northern Mississippi Valley about A.D. 1000, rendering real cognacy unlikely
even if the phonological match were exact (which it is not). Since corn was
most likely introduced into **MA**, **CR** and **HI** from areas to the South, it is
also possible that there has been borrowing from a Dakotan archetype
|†wahúapa|, the dissimilar vowels falling together as long |u•| in the
northern languages.

The term is not demonstrably cognate in MVS either however.  **WI**, **CH**
nasalization is not expected, and **DA** |h| should not be lost.  Several
explanations for the MVS terms are possible, and it is hard to choose among
them (v.  Rankin 1990). (a) The MVS form may be related to **CR**/**HI** |apá•ri|
‘grow, sprout’ which would evolve regularly into |*apa| in MVS.

Incorporating an object noun |ha| ‘covering, skin’, it would be MVS |*há•pa|
‘(it) grows a covering’ or with a noun forming prefix, |wahá•pa| ‘what grows
a covering’, i.e., ‘corn’ with its husks.  (b) The **OP** cognate, |wahába| is
also used to refer to the seed bearing part of cattails, and this may be the
older meaning of the term in MVS with ‘corn’ a later semantic extension. (c)
The term may be a loanword from Muskogean.  Note the Choctaw: |habali|
‘tassel, as corn’ and |habani| ‘be about to tassel’.  The Choctaw root is
|haba-|.  Any of these explanations is plausible, but cognacy across Siouan
is not because of the timing of the introduction of corn.  It should be noted
that other terminology relating to the cultivation, preparation and
consumption of corn is normally specific to particular subgroups in Siouan
betraying its late origin or specialization.",,1
962,{},962,corn > corn mush,"This root is also found with the meaning ‘**428**’, q.v., in

interesting element here is the geographical spread of the form from a

matches DH and **CH**/**WI** words more closely.",,1
964,{},964,corn (3),"Cf. ‘**942**’ for related terms and a fuller lexical set. As with
the other Siouan terms for ‘corn’, we are dealing with borrowing here. This
seems to be the most prominent Mississippi Valley term for ‘corn’. MRS
derives its ‘corn’ words from |*ko-| ‘gourd’.  OVS (**BI**, **OF** only) have a
third distinct term that is similar to some of the Caddoan corn terms.  It
seems clear that the introduction of corn into Siouan-speaking areas
postdates the split of the major subgroups and several of the minor ones.

There is evidence for diffusion of terms within these subgroups as well. The
**TU** form suggests an association with MVS at the time of borrowing, but the
archetype for this term appears to be very widespread, possibly spreading
out of Meso-America with the cultigens themselves, cf. Choctaw and Chickasaw
|ta•nči < tą + ači| ‘corn’, Yuchi |thą| ‘gourd’ and possibly even Keresan
(Proto Keresan |*dâ•ni| ‘squash’ Miller and Davis) for analogs.  Ultimately
linguists and archaeologists working together may be able to trace the
routes of spread.",,1
965,{},965,corn (2),"Cf. other terms for corn and corn parts and products. The **MA** term seems
to be a compound of ‘**766**’, q.v., and ‘**757**’, q.v.

It is this older term that is reconstructible from this set. The present **MA**
word for grass is |xąhe|, and the **MA** glottal in the ‘grass’ part of ‘corn’
is unattested in the rest of Siouan.  Though ‘grass’ may not have been
transparent in this compound in **MA**, ‘gourd’ clearly was; whereas nothing
about the compound would have been transparent in **HI** where the ‘gourd’ word
is |kakuwi|.  Thus it seems likely that the word was transmitted from **MA** to
**HI** and thence to **CR**, where a look-alike form seems to involve an
assimilation of initial |k| to the following |x|. The number of different
terms, their phonological irregularities, and the clear similarities to
terms for corn or related cultigens in neighboring languages all tend to
confirm what archeologists already know, namely that maize was introduced
long after the break up of **PSI**.  Note that three of the four corn terms are
based on local, earlier terms for cucurbits, the only other generally
cultivated vegetable at the time.  Curcurbits precede corn in the
archaeological record by hundreds of years. The portion of the **MA** and
Catawban terms that is alike phonologically is the portion that refers to
cucurbits, probably ‘gourd’.  The use of gourds is quite ancient, and the
morphemes may be cognate (although they contain an element of sound
symbolism). Earliest corn in southern Wisconsin is circa A.D. 1000, north and
west of there, later.  There could have been an old compound but it cannot
have referred to corn.  The **CA** forms, if they signal anything at all, would
have had to have developed independently from some more ancient term with a
distinct but related meaning.",,1

affrication in Dakotan suggests either that this vowel was not the |i-|
attested elsewhere or that the |i-| was lost early and sporadically
replaced. Deverbal instrumental nouns normally show |wa+i| rather than |i-|
by itself.  Thus |i-| is almost certain to have been the inalienable
possessive prefix so often found with body parts.  This prefix normally
disappears in MVS except with kinship terms, so the |i-| in the MVS languages
illustrated here (variable in **DA**, **CH** and **WI**) must represent reapplication of
one of the prefixes of this shape.  Late reapplication would account for lack
of the expected affrication in **DA** (where the form should be a non-occurring
|*ičhą́| if the prefix were old). Since even the forms occurring without the
prefix have reflexes of aspiration, the prefix must be reconstructed to **PMV**
and probably **PSI**.  In MVS the prefix was systematically lost and then
selectively reapplied.

The single language here that suggests a **PSI** form without aspiration is **BI**.

Dorsey fairly consistently transcribes the form with the diacritic for
unaspirated |k|.  He even does this when there is an initial syllable
however, so it is impossible to know how much credence to place in his
transcription.  Cf. ‘**967**’, which may have influenced the **BI** form.

at a variety of different times and from different Algonquian languages or

either from interaction between |m| and |ʔ|, or from the fact that Algonquian

r, R| and a laryngeal articulation |h < ʔ|.  Cf. ‘**1163**’,
‘**215**’, and ‘**1165**’. Thus
the **BI** form suggests an earlier |*r-he| arising through syncope.  In the
cases just cited, the **OF** reflex of |*rh| would seem to be |l|, not |t| as
here, suggesting an earlier form without the |*he| we reconstruct for **PBO**.

**OF** |t| can reflect either |*r| or |*R|.  **OF** initial |i-| is unexplained. **PBO**
|*h| can reflect earlier |*h| or |*ʔ|.  **BI** |-di| is the common suffix
|*-re|.

**QU** |d| reflects |*R| and **OP**, **KS**, and **OS** |n| may perhaps also come from this
source if |n| is the regular reflex of |*R| before a nasal vowel.  **PDH** shows
fairly common loss of intervocalic |ʔ| without merger of the vowels.  If **QU**
is cognate, it reflects metathesis of |*R| and |*į| prior to the nasalization
of |*R|.

**WI** |t| reflects **PSI** |*R|, while **CH** |čʔ| reflects **PMV** |*n, *r, *R, *t|

replaced by |y|.  **MA** |ą| cannot be explained from either |*rį́-ʔE| or |*Ré|.

**PCH** |*areʔ| could reflect an earlier |*arʔE|, |*areʔE|, or |*areʔE| since
**PCH** |CʔV| regularly becomes |CVʔ|, which then develops an echo vowel
(|CVʔV|), whereupon **CR** usually loses the intervocalic glottal stop; cf.

‘**266**’.  In any event, **PCH** initial |a| is unexplained.  **PCH** |r| can
reflect either |*r| or |*R|.  The **PCH** form here may reflect |*re| plus |*ʔE|

**QU** and **WI** clearly reflect |*Re|, while **OP**, **KS**, **OS**, **CH**, and **LA** reflect **PMV**
|*nį-ʔE|.  **WI** and **CH** suggest long vowels in both alternative forms.  **WI**
length may stem from monosyllabic lengthening; **CH** length is either
unaccounted for or suggests an earlier monosyllabic root.  **PSI** length is not
supported by **CR**/**HI**, which would normally retain it.

Accent placement in **MA**, **CH**, **OS** along with initial V present in **PCH**, **QU** and
**OF** may suggest a **PSI** initial syllable, but a **PSI** monosyllable would be
accented anyway.  Nasalization may be secondary where it occurs throughout
the family.  **WI**, **QU**, **BI**/**OF** all suggest that the reconstruction should have

1198,{},1198,"1st singular actor, syncope product (allomorph)","Here, and with the second person analogs, we see the result of the strong tendancy of Mississippi Valley Siouan languages to lose unaccented, short, initial syllable vowels. In the 1Act forms this leaves |*w-| prefixed to numerous consonant-initial stems.  This, in turn, resulted in assimilation of various features from the stem-initial consonant.  In MVS this most frequently produced allomorphs |*p-| before voiceless contoids (incl. |h|), |*b-| before |*r|, and |*m-| before any nasal contoid.  |*m-| also replaces stem-initial |*ʔ| and |*w| as far as we are able to determine, but glottal and W-stems almost always have nasal vowels, perhaps by coincidence.  In a few instances, e.g.  **DA** ‘lie’, DH and dialectal **DA** ‘sit’ positionals, q.v., |*m-| appears to replace stem-initial |*r|, but these verbs also have nasal stem vowels, and the |r| in question may well have been epenthetic as it is in the causative.

Throughout Siouan there has been massive analogical leveling of these consonantal allomorphs of the person-number prefixes with concomitant restoration of the fuller form, |wa-|, or its local reflexes.  The irregular allomorphs are restricted to a few verbs in the modern languages.  These most frequently include verbs of motion, ‘**396**’, ‘**880**’, ‘**1150**’, ‘do’, ‘think’, ‘**53**’, ‘**15**’ and the positionals, ‘**321**’, ‘**216**’, ‘**626**’.  MVS preserves the assimilation products best.  There are few if any cases in **CR**, few in **MA** and almost none in the Southeast.  The few relics that do exist show that syncope was found beyond just MVS however.

The **CR** allomorphs suggest that **CR** underwent some of the same kind of syncope in prefixes that MVS stems did. The rightward shift of accent implies that the syllabic in the prefix was missing, and the fact that the vowels in these same prefixes harmonize for height and rounding suggest that the present-day vowels are the result of a “Dorsey’s Law”-like process.

The same irregular |*ą- > *į-| change applied to the 1st person inclusive |*ą•-| would also yield |hį•-|, thus making |wąąg-| and |hįį-| historically allomorphs.  Since the |ą > į| change is very restricted, this may just be another way of saying that the 1st singular patient has been analogically extended.

|hįį| is actually probably cognate with |mį| in other languages <  |*wį|.  It is strictly ‘dual’ in **WI**.  It is an actor pronominal, whereas |wą•ga| is a patient pronominal. (RR) (Helmbrecht, PC)",,1
